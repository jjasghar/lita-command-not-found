## Installation

Add lita-command-not-found to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

```

## Configuration

None!

## Usage

This plugin is a nice reminder for people who aren't paying attention to their
terminal/windows.

The bot will respond with `Command not found` for a few commands if you
accidentally send it to the channel.

NOTE: I've only started with a few, I'm more then willing to accept other suggestions.
